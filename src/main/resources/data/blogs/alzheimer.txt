Alzheimer's Disease

Understanding Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases.

What is Alzheimer's?

Definition:
A degenerative brain disease that gradually destroys memory, thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. It's not a normal part of aging.

Key Facts:
• Progressive and irreversible
• Most common form of dementia
• Currently no cure
• Can be managed with treatment and support
• Affects 6+ million Americans
• 7th leading cause of death in U.S.

What Happens in the Brain:

Brain Changes:
• Abnormal protein deposits (beta-amyloid plaques)
• Twisted protein fibers (tau tangles)
• Loss of connections between neurons
• Death of brain cells
• Brain shrinkage (atrophy)

Affected Areas:
Initially affects hippocampus (memory center) and entorhinal cortex, then spreads throughout the brain.

Stages of Alzheimer's:

Preclinical Stage:
• No symptoms yet
• Brain changes beginning
• May last years or decades
• Detectable through research imaging/biomarkers

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):
• Noticeable memory problems
• Not severe enough to affect daily life
• Not all MCI progresses to Alzheimer's
• Increased risk of developing Alzheimer's

Mild Alzheimer's (Early Stage):
Duration: 2-4 years typically

Symptoms:
• Memory loss, especially recent events
• Difficulty with problem-solving
• Trouble completing familiar tasks
• Confusion with time or place
• Difficulty finding words
• Misplacing things
• Poor judgment
• Mood and personality changes
• May still function independently in many areas

Moderate Alzheimer's (Middle Stage):
Duration: 2-10 years (longest stage)

Symptoms:
• Increased memory loss and confusion
• Difficulty recognizing family/friends
• Inability to learn new things
• Difficulty with multi-step tasks
• Problems with language (reading, writing)
• Difficulty organizing thoughts
• Wandering and getting lost
• Repetitive statements/movements
• Sleep changes
• Personality changes (suspiciousness, delusions, compulsive behavior)
• Need assistance with activities of daily living

Severe Alzheimer's (Late Stage):
Duration: 1-3 years

Symptoms:
• Severe memory loss
• Physical abilities decline
• Difficulty communicating
• Require full-time assistance
• Vulnerable to infections
• Loss of awareness of surroundings
• Difficulty swallowing
• Require round-the-clock care
• Eventually lose ability to respond to environment

Early Warning Signs:

10 Warning Signs (Alzheimer's Association):

1. Memory loss disrupting daily life
Forgetting recently learned information, important dates, repeatedly asking same questions.

2. Challenges planning or solving problems
Difficulty following plans, working with numbers, concentrating, taking longer to do things.

3. Difficulty completing familiar tasks
Trouble driving to familiar location, managing budget, remembering game rules.

4. Confusion with time or place
Losing track of dates, seasons, passage of time; forgetting where they are or how they got there.

5. Trouble understanding visual images
Difficulty reading, judging distance, determining color/contrast, problems with balance.

6. New problems with words
Trouble following or joining conversation, stopping mid-sentence, repeating, struggling with vocabulary.

7. Misplacing things
Putting things in unusual places, inability to retrace steps, may accuse others of stealing.

8. Decreased or poor judgment
Poor decisions with money, less attention to grooming and cleanliness.

9. Withdrawal from work or social activities
Removing from hobbies, social activities, sports, avoiding social interactions.

10. Changes in mood and personality
Confusion, suspicion, depression, fear, anxiety, easily upset, especially outside comfort zone.

Risk Factors:

Age:
Greatest known risk factor. Most people develop it after 65. Risk doubles every 5 years after 65.

Family History and Genetics:
• Family history increases risk
• APOE-e4 gene increases risk (but doesn't guarantee it)
• Rare genetic mutations cause early-onset (before 65)

Other Risk Factors:
• Head trauma
• Cardiovascular disease
• Diabetes
• High blood pressure
• High cholesterol
• Obesity
• Smoking
• Lack of exercise
• Poor diet
• Low education levels
• Social isolation
• Sleep disorders
• Depression
• Hearing loss (untreated)

Women may be at higher risk due to longer life span and hormonal factors.

Diagnosis:

No Single Test:
Diagnosis through combination of assessments:

Medical History:
• Symptoms
• Family history
• Current medications
• Diet and lifestyle

Physical and Neurological Exam:
• Reflexes
• Muscle tone and strength
• Vision and hearing
• Coordination and balance

Cognitive Testing:
• Memory
• Problem-solving
• Attention
• Counting
• Language

Brain Imaging:
• MRI: Shows brain shrinkage
• CT: Rules out other causes
• PET: Shows amyloid plaques (specialized)

Lab Tests:
Rule out other conditions: vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, infections.

Treatment:

Medications:

Cholinesterase Inhibitors:
• Donepezil (Aricept) - all stages
• Rivastigmine (Exelon) - mild to moderate
• Galantamine (Razadyne) - mild to moderate

How they work: Boost levels of chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment.

Memantine (Namenda):
For moderate to severe. Works on different brain chemical system. May be combined with cholinesterase inhibitor.

Aducanumab (Aduhelm):
Newer, controversial medication targeting amyloid plaques. For early Alzheimer's. Effectiveness debated.

Side Effects:
Vary by medication but may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, increased bowel movements.

Remember: While Alzheimer's is progressive and currently incurable, people can live years with the disease. Quality of life, dignity, and moments of joy are still possible.

Early diagnosis allows for better planning, accessing treatments, and participating in research.

For caregivers: You are not alone. Support, resources, and help are available. Taking care of yourself is not selfish—it's necessary.

Research continues to advance. Hope for better treatments and prevention grows.

Every person's journey with Alzheimer's is unique. With support, compassion, and proper care, individuals and families can navigate this challenging path together.

The person with Alzheimer's is still there—they still need love, connection, and dignity. Focus on what they can still do, not just what's lost.
