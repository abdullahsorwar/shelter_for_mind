Panic & Grounding Techniques

Understanding Panic Attacks
A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. They can be terrifying, making you feel like you're losing control, having a heart attack, or even dying.

Symptoms of Panic Attacks:

Physical:
• Rapid, pounding heart rate
• Sweating and trembling
• Shortness of breath
• Chest pain or tightness
• Nausea or stomach distress
• Dizziness or lightheadedness
• Tingling or numbness
• Chills or hot flashes

Psychological:
• Feeling of impending doom
• Fear of losing control
• Fear of dying
• Feeling detached from reality
• Intense terror
• Sense of unreality

Duration and Triggers:
Panic attacks typically peak within 10 minutes and rarely last more than 30 minutes. They can occur unexpectedly or be triggered by specific situations.

Common Triggers:
• Stressful life events
• Major life transitions
• History of trauma
• Certain medications
• Caffeine or substances
• Phobias
• Health conditions

Panic Disorder vs. Panic Attack:
Having occasional panic attacks doesn't necessarily mean you have panic disorder. Panic disorder involves recurrent attacks and persistent worry about future attacks.
