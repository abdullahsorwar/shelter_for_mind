Dementia

Understanding Dementia
Dementia is not a single disease but an umbrella term for a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking, and social abilities severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. While commonly associated with aging, dementia is not a normal part of getting older.

What is Dementia?

Definition:
A syndrome characterized by progressive decline in cognitive function beyond what might be expected from normal aging. It affects memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgment.

Key Points:
• Progressive condition
• Affects multiple cognitive domains
• Interferes with daily activities
• Not a normal part of aging
• Various causes and types

Types of Dementia:

Alzheimer's Disease (60-80% of cases):
Most common type. Characterized by abnormal protein deposits (plaques and tangles) in the brain.

Symptoms: Memory loss, confusion, difficulty with familiar tasks, language problems.

Vascular Dementia (10% of cases):
Caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often after stroke or series of mini-strokes.

Symptoms: Problems with judgment, planning, and organization. May be sudden or gradual.

Lewy Body Dementia (5-10% of cases):
Caused by abnormal protein deposits (Lewy bodies) in the brain.

Symptoms: Visual hallucinations, movement problems, sleep disturbances, cognitive fluctuations.

Frontotemporal Dementia:
Affects frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Often begins at younger age (45-65).

Symptoms: Personality changes, inappropriate behavior, language difficulties.

Mixed Dementia:
Combination of two or more types, most commonly Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.

Early Warning Signs:

Stages of Dementia:

Early Stage (Mild):

• May still function independently

Middle Stage (Moderate):
• More pronounced memory loss
• Difficulty with communication
• Need help with personal care
• Behavioral changes
• Confusion about events

Late Stage (Severe):
• Near total dependence

Risk Factors:

Non-Modifiable:
• Age (biggest risk factor)
• Family history
• Genetics (certain genes)
• Down syndrome

Modifiable:
• Cardiovascular health issues
• Diabetes
• High blood pressure
• High cholesterol
• Smoking
• Excessive alcohol
• Lack of physical activity
• Poor diet
• Social isolation
• Limited cognitive activity
• Head injuries

• Hearing loss (untreated)

Diagnosis:

Assessment Includes:
• Medical history
• Physical examination
• Neurological tests
• Cognitive and neuropsychological tests
• Brain imaging (MRI, CT, PET scans)
• Blood tests (rule out other causes)
• Psychiatric evaluation

No Single Test:
Diagnosis based on combination of assessments and ruling out other conditions.

Treatment and Management:

Medications:

For Alzheimer's:
• Cholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine)
• Memantine
• Aducanumab (newer, controversial)

Note: Medications may slow progression but don't cure dementia.

Non-Medication Approaches:

Cognitive Stimulation:
• Mental exercises
• Memory games
• Puzzles and problem-solving

• Learn coping strategies
• Maintain independence longer

Speech Therapy:
• Communication strategies
• Swallowing difficulties

Music and Art Therapy:
• Emotional expression
• Memory recall
• Reduces agitation
