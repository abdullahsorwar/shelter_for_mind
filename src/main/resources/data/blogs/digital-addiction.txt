Healthy Technology Use:

Balance is Key:
Technology isn't inherently bad. The goal is mindful, intentional use that enhances rather than replaces real life.

Benefits When Used Well:
• Learning and education
• Staying connected with distant loved ones
• Creative expression
• Information access
• Productivity tools

Mindful Tech Principles:
• Use with intention
• Quality over quantity
• Enhance, don't replace
• Regular check-ins
• Flexibility

Remember: You control technology; don't let it control you. Real life happens offline. Meaningful connections, experiences, and personal growth occur in the present moment, not on a screen.

Recovery is possible. Small changes lead to significant improvements. Start with one change today.
