Treatment Options:

1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Most Effective Treatment:
CBT specifically for social anxiety has strong evidence base.

Components:

Cognitive Restructuring:
• Identify negative automatic thoughts
• Challenge thinking errors
• Reality-test predictions
• Develop balanced, realistic thoughts

Common Thinking Errors:
• Mind reading: "They think I'm boring"
• Catastrophizing: "I'll completely embarrass myself"
• Should statements: "I should be more confident"
• Labeling: "I'm such a loser"
• Fortune telling: "They won't like me"

Exposure Therapy:
Most crucial component:
• Create fear hierarchy (least to most feared)
• Gradual, repeated exposure to feared situations
• Stay in situation until anxiety decreases
• Learn feared outcomes don't occur
• Build confidence through experience

Example Hierarchy:
1. Text a casual acquaintance (20/100)
2. Make small talk with cashier (30/100)
3. Attend small gathering with close friends (40/100)
4. Ask question in class/meeting (50/100)
5. Call to make appointment (60/100)
6. Eat lunch in crowded cafeteria (70/100)
7. Give short presentation (80/100)
8. Attend party alone (90/100)
9. Give major presentation (100/100)

Social Skills Training:
• Learn/practice conversation skills
• Body language and eye contact
• Assertiveness training
• Active listening techniques

Attention Training:
• Shift focus from self to others
• Reduce self-monitoring
• Engage fully in conversations
• External focus exercises

Video Feedback:
• Record yourself in social situations
• Compare perception vs. reality
• Usually perceive self more negatively than reality
• Helps correct distorted self-image

2. Medications

• Paroxetine (Paxil) - FDA approved for SAD
• Sertraline (Zoloft)
• Fluoxetine (Prozac)
• Fluvoxamine (Luvox)

Beta-Blockers (For Performance Anxiety):

• Reduces physical symptoms
• Doesn't treat underlying anxiety

Benzodiazepines (Short-Term Only):
• Clonazepam (Klonopin)
• Alprazolam (Xanax)
• Risk of dependence
• Not long-term solution

MAOIs (When Others Don't Work):
• Phenelzine (Nardil)
• Dietary restrictions required
• Reserved for treatment-resistant cases

Note: Medication + CBT more effective than either alone.

3. Self-Help Strategies

Challenge Negative Thoughts:

Evidence For and Against:
When you think "Everyone will think I'm stupid":
• Evidence for: (Usually minimal)
• Evidence against: No evidence others are thinking this; I've done this before without catastrophe; I tend to overestimate others' judgment

Alternative Thoughts:
• "Most people are focused on themselves, not me"
• "Even if I'm anxious, I can still function"
• "My perception is probably worse than reality"
• "Making mistakes is human"

Behavioral Experiments:

• Example: "If I ask a question, everyone will laugh"
• Try it and see what actually happens
• Collect evidence to challenge beliefs

Gradual Exposure (Self-Directed):
