Remember: Emotional abuse is REAL abuse. The lack of physical scars doesn't make it less damaging. Your pain is valid.

You are not crazy, too sensitive, or overreacting. Trust your feelings.

Abuse is never your fault. You didn't cause it, and you can't fix the abuser.

You deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and love. Always.

Healing is possible. You can recover your sense of self, rebuild your life, and find joy again.

You are stronger than you know. You survived. Now it's time to thrive.

Your story doesn't end with abuse. This is your beginning—a new chapter of freedom, healing, and happiness.
